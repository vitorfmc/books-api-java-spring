### 1. Introduction

This repository brings together a number of identical APIs in different languages, where each one of them integrates with Google Books to generate its own [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) service.
The ultimate goal is to generate an example of communication and integration between two rest APIs using different languages.
